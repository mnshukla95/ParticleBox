# ParticleBox

This project was created using Cocoapods:

For the main application, it used:
  - Alamofire, for network requests
  - ObjectMapper, for parsing JSON
  - Eureka, for a sleek UI Form
  - KeychainAccess, for securing the application token for authorization in requests

  For the application tests, it used:
  - Nimble and Quick for making the tests easier to read and organize
  - Mockingjay, for stubbing network requests

  This project needs to have the command 'pod install' run in the directory containing the
  Podfile and then built and run using the .xcworkspace file.
